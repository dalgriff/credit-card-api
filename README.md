## Current Functionality

The current version of the Credit Card API offers the following features:

1. **Credit Card CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for credit card data.
2. **Validation**: Ensures that credit card numbers are valid using the Luhn algorithm.
3. **Outdated Libraries**: The project uses older versions of several libraries and Spring Boot.

## Proposed Refactor

The upcoming refactoring process aims to modernize the application and introduce best practices. The roadmap includes:

1. **Library Upgrades**: Update all outdated libraries to their latest stable versions.
2. **JDBC to JPA Transition**: Migrate the data access layer from JDBC to JPA, leveraging the power of ORM and reducing boilerplate code.
3. **Security Enhancements**: Introduce security measures to protect the API endpoints.
4. **Deployment Configurations**: Set up configurations to streamline the deployment process.
5. **Docker Integration**: In the future, the project will be containerized using Docker for easier deployment and scalability.
